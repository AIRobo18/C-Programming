Initially running the program with the set number of threads to 10, I did not notice much of a difference between the two. They both ended quite quickly. Although this was not the case when I set the number of cases to 100000. I first ran the fork code and it took 16 seconds to complete, then I ran the thread one and it took 8 seonds to complete. Obviously theads are faster than forks when you run many tests. This is due to the fact that since forks use parent and child, each parent must wait for the entire child to finish then it can run even though their codes are the same, whereas the threads run in uniform and all the threads are theoretically done at the same time thus resulting in faster execution.
