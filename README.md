# C-Programming
Here you will find all my work related to the field of C Programming. These are projects conducted in my time at University. The higher the number, the more challenging the problem was. "1_" implies the first semester, and "2_" implies the second one. Not all of my school files are included in this one as some were getting us accustomed to programming in C. Therefore, I left those out and put more robust labs.

Each lab file will be a different project entirely. Each task builds on top of itself and adds more functionality to it. We were given a span of 5-7 days for each lab/task to complete.
